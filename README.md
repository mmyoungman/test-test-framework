Possible Test Framework Features
================================

* Record passes and failures over multiple runs of the all tests -- helps to identify tests that offer poor ROI.

* A test must fail twice before it is marked as a failure -- guard against unreliable tests.

* More result types than pass and fail -- so a test can be "disabled" but still be run and provide information, even if it doesn't itself cause an entire test run to fail.
